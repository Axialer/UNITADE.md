A regular user might ask why there is a guideline for using the project name and
logo for a plugin under the MIT license, and whether there are any rules concerning
the use of not exactly a trademark but merely the name of a relatively popular product.

> [!Note]
> UNITADE does not prohibit (nor can it prohibit) any actual procedures for using
> its project’s media resources (except in cases of MIT/CC-BY-SA-4.0 violations).
> Please regard this as advice or a handbook with answers to common questions.

### About the Name

The project name **UNITADE.md** (full name) should be written as one word; quotes
may be used (preferably French `« »` or typographic `″ ″` quotes). The name "UNITADE"
must always be written in uppercase, and the optional suffix (i.e., it may be omitted)
".md" must be written either entirely in uppercase (.MD) or entirely in lowercase
(.md). Below are examples of HOW NOT to write the project name:

- unitade.MD
- Unitade
- UNITADE-MD
- unitadeOBSIDIAN (this violates the Obsidian plugin naming convention – mentioning
  the application name is discouraged)
- Unitade.Md

And here are the acceptable versions:

- UNITADE
- UNITADE.md / UNITADE.MD

Prepositions and other parts of speech can be added; think of the plugin as an
"object" that can be generalized or specified (for example, "the", "a", and similar
articles in other languages).

Transliteration into other alphabets, such as Cyrillic, is also discouraged; whenever
possible, always use the project name in English, following the simple rule:
"Use it well".

### About the Logo and Other Elements

Duplication of text and text on the logo (see media files) is allowed, as this
format accounts for cases when images might not load or for purely functional
purposes (such as a README template, etc.).

The primary version of the logo consists of:

- **Foreground:** A chaos symbol (not to be confused with Michael Moorcock’s chaos
  symbol or the Games Workshop copyright) that represents file disorder and what
  "controls" or "guides" the UNITADE project.
- **Background:** A graph symbol, one of the promotional cards for the Obsidian
  application (UNITADE is not affiliated with Obsidian’s authors and merely uses
  their API).

- The logo is inspired by [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/), ISC Licensed.
  More details: [lucide-icon/lucide](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide).

The project’s contrast colors are: bright purple (from the Obsidian palette) and
white/dark; dark purple is used for the secondary logo header.

|              Black                  |      `BLACK`          |                      HEX: `#000000`                    |

\*- *This is an unofficial color name, but we refer to it as such; it resembles
   the application’s color palette and reflects the plugin’s connection to the
   Dynalist product.*

> [!Note]
> Colors that are not affiliated with the logo (for example, the background in
> the Figma file) are not considered logo elements and were created for design
> testing purposes within the repository.

Use the provided logo versions and formats. The only permitted modification is
to use a monochrome or black-and-white version; any other alteration deviates
from the brand guidelines.

Here is what is not allowed:

- It is forbidden to use any colors other than the official purple and the
  contrasting black/white used in the logo palette (do not confuse these with
  background colors).
- It is also forbidden to use an inverted logo (in terms of colors, contrast, etc.).
- Additionally, changing the shape of the icon is prohibited.

> [!Important]
> One might argue that using the two elements separately is acceptable; however,
> doing so results in an element that is not associated with the UNITADE project.
> Therefore, this is considered an edge case. Always remember the rule "Use it well"
> when addressing such matters.
