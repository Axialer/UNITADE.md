The semantics of UNITADE are defined by two release formats:

1. **Releases following the "v\*." pattern**: These releases are created specifically for Semantic Versioning purposes, are independent of Obsidian’s release system, and do not include release notes.
2. **Releases following the "\*." pattern**: These are special releases intended for Obsidian’s plugin update system and include release notes.
