# v3.2.0 — From small to great: Chapter II

This minor release continues the "small to great" approach, focusing on language support, the status bar, command integration, and ecosystem improvements.

## **Language support**

UNITADE now supports all languages available in Obsidian. Contrary to expectations, this process is not automatic, requiring manual integration when new languages are introduced.

>[!Important]
> Community contributions to translations are strongly encouraged.

With this update, language-related errors should be significantly reduced for the LTS cycle of the plugin.

- The "v3*" branch is now designated as LTS, receiving only minor updates and maintenance fixes.

## **Status bar**

A new status bar has been integrated, providing real-time insights into:

- The active worker (processor-handler) assigned to the file;
- Registered extensions:
  - Markdown extensions;
  - Unique grouped extensions;
  - Code editor-specific extensions;
- Active registered views;
- Cursor position in the editor (caret tracking);
- The rendering mode assigned to the open file.

The status bar fully supports localization and allows modular customization—users can enable or disable individual elements.

## **Commands and functionality**

New commands have been introduced, enabling quick interactions with core plugin functionality:

1. Toggle multiple modes simultaneously:
   - Safe mode;
   - Case-ignoring mode;
   - Markdown overload mode;
2. Add markdown-compatible extensions via a modal;
3. Add code editor-specific extensions via a dedicated modal.

## **Ecosystem and styling integration**

- Styles are now applied adaptively via CSS cascades instead of JavaScript.
- New API elements have been integrated, increasing interoperability with other plugins.
- The plugin expands its API for direct runtime cooperation with external projects.

## **New versions, new challenges**

Obsidian v1.8 introduced changes affecting copy-paste functionality in the code editor. To address this:

- A new setting allows users to restore the classic **Ctrl+V** functionality alongside the new **Ctrl+Shift+V** behavior.
- This setting is only required for Obsidian v1.8+; in other cases, the default **Ctrl+V** behavior remains unchanged.
