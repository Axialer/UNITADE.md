## Release Note for v3.2.2

This patch fixes several bugs related to legacy and non-trivial code:

- Fix #107: The text cursor lag issue related to OBSIDIAN's pipeline integration is now resolved and tested.
- (#113) Fixed a warning related to passive reading of mouse button events in the code editor view.
- (#112) Fixed a major issue with the compatibility module: it was not backwards compatible with itself when downloading a plugin for the first time or when no manifest version was present, leading to configuration issues.

Additionally, a bug where changing the font size while scrolling in the code editor caused the entire file system to "blink" (code files disappearing and reappearing) has been fixed. Visual settings updates are now moved to a partial function to prevent this. (#114)
