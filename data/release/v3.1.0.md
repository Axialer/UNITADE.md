### Release v3.1.0

**Introduction:**
This version initiates a series of incremental updates designed to refine the plugin's look, infrastructure, and functionality. The cornerstone of this release is the introduction of **Safe Mode**, aimed at protecting the plugin ecosystem from unintended modifications while enhancing stability and security. Additionally, significant bug fixes improve compatibility and theme handling.

### Key Features:

#### Safe Mode

As identified in **Issue #85**, the plugin previously allowed users to manipulate binary extensions, potentially leading to ecosystem corruption. The new **Safe Mode** prevents such issues by restricting the ability to open extensions directly in the application.

- Users can still access and modify settings.
- Files are viewable as code using the **extensions-as-markdown** functionality without risking metadata corruption.
- This solution mitigates the risk of Obsidian corrupting file metadata, preserving indentation and preventing structural damage when editing via Codeview.

### Bug Fixes:

1. **Theme Detection Fixes:**
   - Corrected an issue where the default color theme was not properly recognized and was assigned as "unnamed." The standard theme is now correctly identified as **AUTO**.

2. **Mobile Compatibility Module:**
   - The mobile configuration is now fully integrated with the latest versions of the compatibility module.
   - Previously, mobile configurations were outdated, failing to update with new releases. This issue has been resolved, ensuring consistent behavior across desktop and mobile environments.
