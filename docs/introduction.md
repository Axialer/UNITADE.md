Welcome to the UNITADE.md (or just "UNITADE") plugin’s Wikipedia page. Here you will find comprehensive documentation and detailed information about the plugin's features, including insights into file views and registries.

**UNITADE**, derived from the Latin term for "united" or "unity," is a plugin developed for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It extends the capabilities of Obsidian by enabling users to work with non-markdown files, including those that are not natively supported by the software. Initially, UNITADE.md started as a small project designed to bypass the need to open external editors, such as VS Code or IDEs, to view code and write documentation for projects. Over time, it has grown into a powerful tool that offers users an experience similar to working within a code editor, allowing for much greater flexibility and functionality within Obsidian.

The plugin supports any language that Obsidian itself supports, although certain translations may not be available yet.

Users are encouraged to contribute translations, not only for the plugin but also for this wiki, which will benefit from the community’s input. For guidelines on how to contribute, please refer to the [Contribution Policy of UNITADE](https://github.com/Falcion/UNITADE.md/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the general [GitHub Documentation on Contributing to a Project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).

By contributing to UNITADE.md, you help build a more inclusive and comprehensive experience for all users.
