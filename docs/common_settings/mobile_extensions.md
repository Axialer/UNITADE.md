Mobile extensions are a sub-configuration of the extension settings within the UNITADE plugin, specifically activated when Obsidian is used on a mobile device.

These mobile extensions mimic the default extension settings but are tailored for mobile-specific configurations and plugin instances. This can be especially useful when you access your Vault via Obsidian Sync on your phone.

> [!Note]
> In cases where the configuration is corrupted or encounters unforeseen issues, the plugin will attempt to initialize the default configuration. Therefore, when working with mobile devices, itâ€™s recommended to sync both the default and mobile extension configurations to avoid potential conflicts.

This module is only displayed on mobile devices, or when manually enabled through a special toggle button on the settings page.
